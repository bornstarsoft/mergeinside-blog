In a troubling turn of events, Build a Rocket Boy, the studio behind the much-anticipated game MindsEye, has reportedly initiated mass layoff proceedings that could affect over 100 employees. This news comes on the heels of significant backlash following the game's troubled launch, which has been marred by technical issues and a dismal reception from players and critics alike. With a Metacritic score of just 38 for the PC version and a mere 28 for the PS5, MindsEye has become one of the lowest-rated games of the year, prompting PlayStation to issue refundsâ€”a rare move that echoes the infamous launch of Cyberpunk 2077.

The studio has begun a 45-day consultation process, a requirement under UK law when planning to lay off 100 or more employees. This situation raises concerns not only for the affected staff but also for the future of the studio itself, which has a total of around 300 employees in the UK and an additional 200 overseas. The fallout from MindsEye's launch has been severe, with social media flooded with complaints about bugs and gameplay issues, leading to a significant loss of player trust.

As the gaming community watches closely, the question remains: can Build a Rocket Boy recover from this setback and regain the confidence of its players? The studio has expressed its commitment to improving the player experience, but whether this will be enough to turn the tide remains to be seen.
