NINES is set to captivate puzzle enthusiasts with their upcoming title, **Pipeworks Puzzle**, a fresh take on the classic tile sliding puzzle genre. This game promises not only charming visuals but also a soothing soundtrack that aims to create a relaxing gaming experience. Players will step into the shoes of a plumber at a bustling construction site, tasked with arranging disordered pipes to match a provided blueprint. The challenge lies in navigating a grid-based arena where movement is limited to the cardinal directions—up, down, left, and right.

One of the standout features of Pipeworks Puzzle is its engaging support character, affectionately known as ‘Boss’. Designed by the talented PokuriMio, Boss will guide players from novice to master plumber, adding a layer of narrative that enhances the gameplay experience. As players progress, they can look forward to unlocking exciting new features by wishlisting the game on Steam, including an endless mode, speedrun challenges, and even a quirky cat companion!

With a demo on the horizon and a full release scheduled for later this year, now is the perfect time to keep an eye on Pipeworks Puzzle. Will you be ready to tackle the pipes and become the ultimate plumbing master?
