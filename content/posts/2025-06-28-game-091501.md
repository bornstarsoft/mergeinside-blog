A recent leak has unveiled 15 minutes of gameplay from the upcoming Battlefield title, showcasing the classic Rush mode. This mode, which pits attackers against defenders in a race against time and limited respawns, has been a fan favorite across multiple Battlefield games. The excitement surrounding this leak highlights the community's eagerness for a fresh take on a beloved format.

Electronic Arts has confirmed that the next Battlefield game is set for release by March 2026, with a full reveal expected this summer. This time, EA is taking a more transparent approach to development, aiming to rebuild trust after the mixed reception of Battlefield 2042. The game has been in closed testing since March, and while testers are sworn to secrecy, the leaked footage suggests that EA is keen to generate buzz ahead of the official announcement.

As four internal studios collaborate to create a connected universe set in modern times, fans are left wondering how this new installment will innovate while honoring the franchise's legacy. Will the return of Rush mode satisfy long-time players, or will it be just one piece of a larger puzzle? Only time will tell as we await more details this summer.
