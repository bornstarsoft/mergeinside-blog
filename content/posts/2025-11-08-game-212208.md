In a recent update, BioWare has reassured fans that the highly anticipated Mass Effect 5 is still in development, despite ongoing concerns surrounding EA's impending sale to private investors. Executive producer Mike Gamble addressed these worries directly, emphasizing that both EA and BioWare remain committed to expanding the beloved Mass Effect universe. This commitment comes at a time when the gaming community is eager for news, especially after a teaser trailer was released two years ago.

Gamble's message was clear: the development team is focused solely on Mass Effect, with plenty of stories, features, and romances to explore. He acknowledged the fans' thirst for updates and hinted at exciting developments to come, promising that the wait will be worth it. Additionally, the upcoming Mass Effect live-action series, set to take place after the original trilogy, adds another layer of anticipation for fans.

As we look forward to more news from BioWare, one has to wonder: what new adventures await us in the Mass Effect universe? Will we see familiar faces or entirely new characters? Only time will tell, but for now, fans can rest easy knowing that Mass Effect 5 is still on the horizon.
