Square Enix has officially revealed that Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade will be the largest game on the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2, with a staggering file size of up to 99GB. This means that installing the game could take up nearly 40% of the console's base storage, which is set at 249GB. Such a significant storage requirement raises questions about how players will manage their game libraries on the new platform.

While other AAA titles like Hogwarts Legacy and Cyberpunk 2077 have managed to keep their file sizes relatively smaller, the sheer scale of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade highlights the ambitious nature of this RPG. The game's director, Naoki Hamaguchi, emphasized the importance of maintaining high-quality graphics, particularly in lighting, to ensure that the Switch 2 version does not compromise on visual fidelity compared to its PS5 counterpart.

As we look forward to the game's release on January 22, it will be interesting to see how players adapt to the storage limitations of the Nintendo Switch 2. Will this push for larger file sizes influence future game development and console design? Only time will tell.
