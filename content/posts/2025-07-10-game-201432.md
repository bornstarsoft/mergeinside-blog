In the wake of significant layoffs at Microsoft, Rare is set to unveil the future of its flagship title, Sea of Thieves, during its first-ever Community Direct. Scheduled for tomorrow at 3 PM UK / 10 AM ET, this broadcast promises insights into upcoming Seasons and major changes to the Insider Programme, alongside a highly anticipated feature that has been in development.

This announcement comes shortly after Rare experienced a shake-up, losing several veteran developers, including the influential Gregg Mayles, following the cancellation of their ambitious project, Everwild. With Microsoft reportedly cutting around 9,100 jobs, the gaming community is left wondering how these changes will impact Rare and its beloved titles moving forward.

As Rare navigates these turbulent waters, fans are eager to see how the studio will adapt and innovate in the face of adversity. Will the upcoming Community Direct provide the reassurance players need, or will it signal a more uncertain future for the studio? Only time will tell.
