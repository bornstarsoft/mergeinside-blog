Microsoft has just unveiled the first wave of titles coming to Xbox Game Pass for November, and it's a lineup that gamers won't want to miss. Notably, the highly anticipated Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will be available for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers starting November 14. This addition is sure to excite fans of the franchise and those looking to dive into new gaming experiences this month.

Alongside Call of Duty, a total of 11 games are set to join the Game Pass library in the first half of November, including intriguing titles like Dead Static Drive and Sniper Elite Resistance.
