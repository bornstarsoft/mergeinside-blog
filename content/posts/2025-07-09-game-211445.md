In an exciting turn of events for gamers, Marvel's Midnight Suns, a critically acclaimed superhero RTS game developed by Firaxis, is now available for free as part of Amazon Prime's Prime Day celebrations. This offer allows Prime members to claim the game and keep it forever, a significant advantage over other subscription services like PlayStation Plus and Xbox Game Pass, which only provide access as long as the subscription is active.

This month, Prime Gaming is also featuring other notable titles, including the praised game Venba. However, despite its warm reception from critics, Midnight Suns faced disappointing sales shortly after its release, leading to a significant price drop. Take-Two's CEO, Zelnick, acknowledged that the timing of the game's launch may not have been ideal but expressed optimism for its long-term sales potential.

As we witness the evolving landscape of gaming subscriptions and offers, it raises the question: will more developers consider similar strategies to boost their game's visibility and sales in the future?
