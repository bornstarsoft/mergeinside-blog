Wordle has taken the world by storm, captivating players with its simple yet challenging format. Today's answer, "Vixen," not only showcases the game's cleverness but also highlights the importance of strategic guessing. With just six attempts to uncover a five-letter word, players must employ both logic and a bit of vocabulary knowledge to succeed.

One of the standout tips from the Wordle community is to start with a versatile word like "trace." This approach maximizes the chances of identifying correct letters and their positions early on. Today's word, a noun that refers to a female fox, features two vowels—'I' and 'E'—and no repeating letters, making it a perfect example of how to leverage vowel placement in your guesses.

As you continue to play and refine your strategy, consider how each word choice can lead to a more efficient solving process. What will your next starter word be, and how will it shape your gameplay?
