In a surprising turn of events, Romero Games has publicly denied reports of its closure, asserting that the studio is still operational and exploring new publishing opportunities. This statement comes in the wake of Microsofts recent funding cuts that left the studio's unannounced first-person shooter project in jeopardy.

The studio, co-founded by gaming legends John and Brenda Romero, confirmed that while funding for their project was pulled, they have been approached by several other publishers interested in potentially reviving the game. This proactive stance highlights the resilience of the team and their commitment to navigating through these turbulent times.

As the gaming industry continues to face significant challenges, the situation at Romero Games serves as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of game development and the importance of support from publishers. Will we see a revival of their ambitious project, or will this be another cautionary tale in the gaming world? Stay tuned for updates as the story unfolds.
