In a surprising turn of events, NetEase has decided to cancel the much-anticipated retro-futuristic adventure game, The Midnight Riders, developed by Bad Brain Game Studios. This decision comes as part of a broader cost-cutting initiative within the company, leaving fans and developers alike disheartened. The game, which promised a nostalgic journey through a Stranger Things-esque narrative, had garnered attention for its unique blend of 1980s aesthetics and thrilling gameplay.

Despite the cancellation, Bad Brain's head, Sean Crooks, remains hopeful. He recently shared a five-minute sizzle reel showcasing the game's potential, featuring a young protagonist named Josh who embarks on a quest to uncover the mystery behind the disappearance of local children. With its engaging storyline and captivating visuals, The Midnight Riders had the makings of a cult classic, reminiscent of beloved titles from the past.

As the studio prepares to close its doors on November 17, there is still a glimmer of hope. Crooks mentioned that both Bad Brain and NetEase are open to selling the game's intellectual property, which could pave the way for another developer to breathe life into this intriguing project. Will we see The Midnight Riders rise from the ashes, or is this the end of the road for this promising adventure?
