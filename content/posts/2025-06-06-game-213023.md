Get ready for a mind-bending experience as **UnLoop**, a unique puzzle game developed by CM Games, is set to launch on Quest and Pico this fall. This game takes the concept of time manipulation to a whole new level, challenging players to record their actions and use them strategically to solve intricate puzzles. The gameplay is reminiscent of the innovative mechanics found in titles like *We Are One*, where players must literally help themselves by stacking their recorded actions to navigate through a vibrant yet perilous space station.

Set within the confines of the Temporal Research Hub, players will face a series of run-ending obstacles, including turrets and laser walls. The twist? To overcome these challenges, players must be willing to sacrifice themselves first, creating a loop of actions that can be rewritten and refined as they progress. The game features diverse sectors, such as the Nexus Frame and Asset Assembly Factory, each introducing new mechanics that heighten the chaos and complexity of the puzzles.

With its intriguing premise and engaging gameplay, UnLoop promises to be a standout title in the VR puzzle genre. As we await its release, one can't help but wonder how this innovative approach to time manipulation will resonate with players. Will it redefine the way we think about puzzle-solving in virtual reality?
