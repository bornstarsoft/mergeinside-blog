In a powerful move against the dehumanization of Palestinians, over 50 game industry professionals have united to form Palestinian Voices in Games. This coalition aims to uplift Palestinian game developers by providing essential support and resources, ensuring their stories are told and heard on a global stage. By fostering a professional network, they are not just advocating for representation but also for economic empowerment in a field that often overlooks marginalized voices.

The coalition includes notable game studios and curators who are dedicated to combating the underrepresentation of Palestinians in the gaming industry. Their efforts are not only about creating games but also about creating a community where Palestinian creators can thrive. With projects like Dreams on a Pillow and RiYafa already in the pipeline, the coalition is actively seeking to expand its reach and impact.

As we look to the future, the question remains: how can we further support initiatives like Palestinian Voices in Games to ensure that diverse narratives are woven into the fabric of the gaming industry?
