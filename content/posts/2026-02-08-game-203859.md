If you're a fan of puzzle games but often find them too challenging, then Botany Manor might just be the perfect fit for you. Currently available for free on the Epic Games Store, this cozy first-person puzzle game invites players to step into the shoes of botanist Arabella Greene, who explores a Victorian manor to complete her botanical research. Unlike other puzzle games that can leave you feeling frustrated, Botany Manor strikes a balance between engaging gameplay and accessibility, making it ideal for casual gamers.

The developers have crafted an experience that emphasizes a peaceful setting and thoughtfully designed puzzles. Lead developer Laure De May mentioned that the challenge lies not in the difficulty of the puzzles themselves but in the number of clues and steps involved. This makes Botany Manor a welcoming choice for those who appreciate a more relaxed gaming experience without the pressure of high-stakes problem-solving.

As the game is free until February 12, now is the perfect time to dive into this charming world. Whether you're a seasoned puzzle enthusiast or just looking for a casual gaming experience, Botany Manor offers something for everyone. Will you take the plunge into this delightful puzzle adventure?
