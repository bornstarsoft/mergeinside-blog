Each game invites players to think outside the box, reshaping their environment and perceptions in unique ways.

This innovative mechanic lets you create new pathways and explore hidden secrets without the pressure of timers. Next, **Gorogoa** takes a different approach by encouraging players to rearrange beautifully hand-drawn panels to solve intricate puzzles. Its BAFTA-winning design makes it a must-try for art lovers and puzzle enthusiasts alike. Finally, **Superliminal** invites you to navigate a dream-like world where perspective is everything.
