The excitement is building as the Disney Afternoon Collection is set to make its debut on the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, adding two beloved titles to the mix. Scheduled for release on February 26, 2026, this collection not only brings nostalgia but also introduces gamers to the classic adventures of Bonkers and Goof Troop, both of which were originally licensed from Disney to Capcom.

With the recent confirmation from Atari and the listing appearing in the Japanese eShop, fans are eager to see how these games will perform on the latest Nintendo hardware. The inclusion of Bonkers, a 2D platformer featuring the quirky officer Bonkers D. Bobcat, and Goof Troop, an action game co-designed by Shinji Mikami, adds depth to a collection that already holds a special place in the hearts of many.

As we await the official announcement, possibly during an upcoming Nintendo Direct, it's clear that this collection is poised to attract both nostalgic players and new fans alike. Will you be pre-ordering this collection to relive the magic of Disney's animated classics?
