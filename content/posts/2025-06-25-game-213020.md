Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is set to shake up the racing genre by eliminating items that allow players to easily come back from behind. Takashi Iizuka, head of Sonic Team, emphasized that the game will not feature high-powered items like the infamous Blue Shell from Mario Kart, which often frustrates players by enabling last-minute victories. Instead, the focus is on creating a balanced and fair racing experience that prioritizes skill over luck.

In a recent interview, Iizuka explained that the development team initially designed the game without any items to ensure a solid racing foundation. After extensive playtesting, they decided to include items that enhance the chaos of racing without compromising fairness. This approach aims to provide a thrilling experience while maintaining a level playing field for all racers.

As Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds prepares for its release on September 25, it will introduce a variety of crossover characters and tracks, appealing to fans of multiple franchises. This unique blend of gameplay and character diversity could redefine what players expect from racing games in the future. Will this new direction resonate with gamers looking for a more skill-based racing experience?
