Nintendo has just announced that the beloved GameCube launch title, Luigis Mansion, will be available on the Switch 2s Nintendo Classics service starting October 30, perfectly timed for Halloween. This classic game, originally released in 2001, has players guiding Luigi through a haunted mansion in search of his brother Mario, armed with the quirky Poltergust 3000 vacuum.

With this addition, all three Luigis Mansion games will be playable on a single console for the first time, offering fans a nostalgic trip down memory lane. The Switch 2 library is rapidly expanding, now featuring six GameCube titles, including iconic games like The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and Super Mario Strikers. For those who want to enhance their experience, a wireless GameCube controller is also available, making it easier to relive those classic gaming moments.

As we look forward to more GameCube titles being added, including fan favorites like Super Mario Sunshine and Pokmon XD: Gale of Darkness, its an exciting time for Nintendo fans. Are you ready to dive back into the spooky adventures of Luigi?
