In a remarkable feat for the hybrid-casual gaming sector, Pixel Flow has successfully closed a seed funding round just three months post-launch. This achievement not only highlights the game's impressive scaling efforts but also underscores the commercial viability of the hybrid-casual genre, as evidenced by its entry into the Top 25 of the US App Store Top Grossing chart and its seven-figure daily revenue.

Developed by the talented Istanbul-based duo Kbra Gundogan and Emre elik, who previously worked on Twisted Tangle, Pixel Flow's success is a testament to the potential of hybrid-casual games to reach broad audiences while generating sustainable revenue. Following the recent investment, the team is poised to further expand their scaling efforts, indicating a bright future for this innovative gaming category.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, will we see more hybrid-casual games breaking into the mainstream?
