Exciting news for gamers! The beloved Far Cry 3 Classic Edition is set to receive a significant update that will enhance gameplay on the PS5 and PS5 Pro by introducing 60 FPS support. This update, which is scheduled for release on January 21, promises to deliver a smoother and more immersive experience for players revisiting this classic title from 2012.

Ubisoft announced the update through their official channels, including the PlayStation YouTube account, generating buzz among fans. While Xbox Series S and X players have already enjoyed the 60 FPS experience, many PS4 owners have expressed disappointment over the lack of similar support for their consoles. For those looking to dive into the action, the game is available as part of the Far Cry Anthology Bundle on the PlayStation Store, currently discounted to $37.49 until January 22.

As we look forward to this update, it raises an interesting question: how will this impact the nostalgia factor for long-time fans of the series? Will the enhanced performance breathe new life into the gameplay?
