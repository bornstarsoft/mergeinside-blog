A recent domain registration has sparked renewed interest in the potential title for the upcoming Super Mario Bros Movie 2, suggesting it may be called The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. This speculation stems from a photo shared on Reddit two months ago, featuring limited edition Old Spice deodorant cans adorned with characters like Luigi and Yoshi, and a logo that hinted at the movie's title.

While some initially dismissed the image as a hoax, the recent registration of domain names by NBCUniversal has lent credibility to the claim. The domains, including supermariogalaxy.movie, were registered shortly before a Nintendo Direct announcement, hinting that the title may indeed be legitimate. Additionally, trademark registrations for themed scents suggest a deeper connection to the movie's plot, possibly involving adventures in desert landscapes and urban settings.

As we await further details from the upcoming Nintendo Direct, fans are left to wonder: will this sequel truly explore the galaxy, and what other surprises might be in store? Stay tuned for more updates as the release date approaches!
