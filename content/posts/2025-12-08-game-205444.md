In a bold move, YS Net, the studio founded by legendary game designer Yu Suzuki, has publicly denied any affiliation with a purported Shenmue 4 trailer that has been circulating on social media. The studio's statement comes in response to a video that allegedly showcases footage from the highly anticipated RPG sequel, which they claim is misleading and possibly AI-generated.

The studio emphasized that the video, which misuses their logo, has "absolutely no connection to YS Net" and that they have not released any official promotional materials for Shenmue 4. YS Net is taking this matter seriously and is exploring legal options to protect their brand and the integrity of their upcoming projects. This situation raises important questions about the authenticity of content shared online and the implications of AI in media creation.

As the gaming community eagerly awaits news about Shenmue 4, this incident serves as a reminder of the challenges developers face in maintaining control over their intellectual property. How will this affect the future of game marketing and fan engagement? Only time will tell.
