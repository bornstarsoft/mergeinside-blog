Square Enix's latest comparison video showcases the impressive capabilities of the Switch 2, particularly in how it handles the visually demanding Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade. While the Switch 2 is less powerful than the PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC, the video demonstrates that it can still deliver a visually appealing experience, especially in the game's opening sequence. The subtle differences in texture quality are often hard to discern, highlighting the optimization efforts made for this port.

One of the standout insights from the video is the emphasis on maintaining high-quality lighting, as noted by the game's director, Naoki Hamaguchi. He explained that compromising on lighting would detract from character expressions and overall graphical fidelity. Instead, the development team focused on optimizing other elements, such as fog and post-processing effects, ensuring that the Switch 2 version runs smoothly at a stable 30 frames per second without sacrificing visual integrity.

As we look forward to the game's release on January 22, it's exciting to see how developers are pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved on less powerful hardware. Will the Switch 2 version of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade set a new standard for handheld gaming graphics? Only time will tell.
