In a world increasingly influenced by technology, renowned Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu stands firm against the use of generative AI in music composition. Uematsu believes that the true reward of creating music lies in the personal effort and struggle involved in the process. He states, Ive never used it, and I probably never will, emphasizing that the satisfaction derived from crafting something uniquely human is irreplaceable.

Uematsu also highlights the importance of the artist's background in enriching the listener's experience. Unlike AI, which lacks personal history and emotional depth, human composers bring a unique narrative to their work. This perspective raises intriguing questions about the future of music creation as technology continues to evolve.

While Uematsu may not embrace AI for composing music, he acknowledges its potential in other areas, such as enhancing audio transitions in video games. As the gaming industry continues to innovate, it will be fascinating to see how the balance between human creativity and technological advancements unfolds. Will we see a future where AI complements rather than replaces the artistry of human composers?
