Konami is bringing back a beloved series with the release of a 13-game Goemon collection this summer for Nintendo Switch, PS5, and PC. This compilation, titled "Ganbare Goemon! Daishuugou," showcases classic titles from the Famicom, Super Famicom, and Game Boy eras, making it a must-have for retro gaming enthusiasts. However, its worth noting that the collection is currently only set for release in Japan, which raises questions about accessibility for international fans.

The collection promises exciting new features such as rewind, quick save, and turbo buttons, enhancing the gameplay experience for both new players and nostalgic fans. Additionally, the inclusion of a music player and a gallery showcasing each games instruction manual adds a layer of appreciation for the series history. With titles like "The Legend of the Mystical Ninja" and "Ganbare Goemon 3," this collection is a treasure trove of gaming history.

As we look forward to its release, its intriguing to consider whether Konami might expand the availability of this collection beyond Japan. Will we see a global release, or will fans have to rely on imports?
