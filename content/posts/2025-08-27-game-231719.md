Pragmata is shaping up to be a fascinating addition to the gaming landscape, merging puzzle-solving with traditional shooter mechanics in a way that feels both fresh and engaging. During my recent hands-on session at Gamescom 2025, I discovered that this game, set against the backdrop of a distant lunar base, challenges players to think strategically while also keeping their reflexes sharp.

The gameplay revolves around a unique mechanic where players complete mini-puzzles to unleash devastating attacks on enemies. This blend of action and puzzle-solving creates a dynamic experience that keeps you on your toes, reminiscent of juggling multiple tasks in a high-stakes environment. The vibrant visuals and the quirky interactions between characters, particularly between the astronaut Hugh and his robot companion Diana, add to the charm of the game, making it a title to watch out for in 2026.

As we anticipate its release on PC and next-gen consoles, its exciting to think about how Pragmata will evolve and what other innovative mechanics Capcom might introduce. Will this game redefine how we think about the shooter genre?
