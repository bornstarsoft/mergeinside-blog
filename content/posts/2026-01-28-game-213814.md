Highguard has made a significant splash in the gaming community, attracting nearly 100,000 concurrent players on its launch day. However, this impressive player count is contrasted by a staggering 13,000 negative reviews on Steam, raising questions about the game's overall reception and quality. The mixed feedback highlights a disconnect between player enthusiasm and gameplay satisfaction, particularly regarding the game's expansive map size in its 3vs3 matchups.

Developed by Wildlight Entertainment, a studio formed by veterans from popular franchises like Apex Legends and Call of Duty, Highguard's launch was highly anticipated, especially after its prominent reveal at The Game Awards. Yet, despite the initial excitement, the game has struggled to maintain a positive perception among players, with only about 32% of reviews being favorable.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how Highguard addresses these concerns and whether it can turn the tide of public opinion. Will future updates and community engagement help the game find its footing, or will it remain a cautionary tale of high expectations versus reality?
