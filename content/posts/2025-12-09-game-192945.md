In a recent discussion at the G-Star game developer convention, Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii expressed his enthusiasm for integrating AI chatbots into future games. He envisions a gaming experience where players can solve mysteries alongside a virtual partner powered by AI, enhancing the interactive storytelling that has become a hallmark of modern gaming.

Horii highlighted the potential of AI, particularly referencing tools like ChatGPT, which he finds capable of engaging in logical conversations. His idea of a quiz or mystery game, where players interact with an AI to uncover clues and solve cases, could redefine how narratives unfold in video games. This innovative approach could lead to deeper player engagement and a more immersive experience.

As we look to the future of gaming, the integration of AI could transform not just gameplay mechanics but also the very essence of storytelling within games. How do you think AI will shape the next generation of interactive entertainment?
