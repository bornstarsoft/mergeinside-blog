In an inspiring display of community spirit, a charity quiz has successfully raised over 2 million for Marie Curie over the past 18 years. This annual event, organized by the North East fundraising group, has become a beloved fixture in the region, drawing teams of up to six participants eager to test their knowledge across various topics, from general knowledge to music and sports.

The growth in participation over the years highlights not just the quiz's popularity, but also the community's commitment to supporting those affected by terminal illnesses. Every penny raised contributes to Marie Curie's vital work in providing care and support for patients and their families, making a tangible difference in their lives.
