Red Dead Redemption fans have something to look forward to, as Rob Wiethoff, the actor behind the iconic character John Marston, has teased "exciting news" related to the franchise. During a recent livestream, Wiethoff hinted that he has information that will thrill fans, stating, “I can’t share it with you right now, and it’s absolutely killing me.” This revelation has sparked speculation about a current-generation version of Red Dead Redemption 2, particularly in light of recent reports suggesting its potential release on the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2.

Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has also weighed in on the Switch 2, indicating that the publisher is committed to providing robust support for the platform at launch. With multiple titles lined up for the new console, including Civilization VI and Borderlands 4, the addition of Red Dead Redemption 2 could significantly enhance the Switch 2's appeal. This aligns with Wiethoff's excitement, as he anticipates sharing more details before the week concludes.

As we await further announcements, the gaming community is buzzing with anticipation. Will this be the moment Red Dead Redemption 2 makes its mark on a new platform? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure: the excitement surrounding the franchise is palpable.
