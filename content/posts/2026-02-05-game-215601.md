Valve has recently announced that the pricing and release details for its much-anticipated Steam Machine and Steam Frame have been delayed due to the skyrocketing costs of PC components. In a blog post, the company acknowledged that the ongoing memory and storage shortages have significantly impacted their ability to provide concrete pricing and launch dates, which were initially expected to be shared by now.

The company remains committed to releasing these products in the first half of the year but is taking the necessary time to ensure that they can confidently announce pricing that reflects the current market conditions. With memory prices reportedly increasing by over 170% year-over-year, driven by major agreements affecting supply chains, Valve is not alone in facing these challenges. Other tech giants, including Microsoft, are also feeling the pinch.

As the gaming community eagerly awaits the Steam Machine, which was estimated to retail around $700, it raises questions about how these price hikes will affect consumer accessibility and the future of gaming hardware. Will Valve be able to navigate these turbulent waters and deliver a product that meets expectations? Only time will tell.
