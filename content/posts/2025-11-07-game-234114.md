In a significant turn of events for the gaming industry, Bad Brain Game Studios, a subsidiary of NetEase, has announced its impending shutdown after failing to secure a new partner for its ambitious project, Midnight Riders. The studio, based in Canada, will cease operations on November 17th, 2025, leaving behind a team that has dedicated itself to pushing creative and technical boundaries in game development.

Studio head Sean Cooks expressed gratitude towards NetEase for their support during this challenging journey. Despite their efforts, the search for a partner to continue the project did not materialize. This situation serves as a stark reminder of the volatile nature of the gaming industry, particularly for indie developers who often rely on partnerships and funding to bring their visions to life.

As Bad Brain Game Studios prepares to close this chapter, the underlying intellectual property of Midnight Riders remains available for acquisition or partnership. This opens the door for other publishers or studios that see potential in the project. Will we see a revival of Midnight Riders under new stewardship, or is this the end of the road for this promising title? Only time will tell.
