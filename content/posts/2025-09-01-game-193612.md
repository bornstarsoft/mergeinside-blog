Each level introduces more complex rules and board layouts, ensuring that players of all skill levels can find a suitable challenge. Understanding the game mechanics is crucial, especially the colored regions that dictate the mathematical requirements for each area. 

As you play, remember that the key to success lies in mastering the symbols that represent the rules for each colored region. Whether you're a seasoned puzzle solver or a newcomer, Pips offers a refreshing take on logic puzzles that will keep you engaged. Will you rise to the challenge and conquer the board?
