In an exciting development for football gaming enthusiasts, Netflix is set to release a new FIFA game in time for the World Cup this summer. With Julien Merceron, the former chief technology officer of Konamis Fox Engine, at the helm, the game promises to reimagine the FIFA series from the ground up, marking a significant shift in the gaming landscape.

Mercerons extensive experience with the Fox Engine, which powered iconic titles like Metal Gear Solid 5 and the Pro Evolution Soccer series, positions him uniquely to lead this ambitious project. Delphi Interactive, the studio behind the new FIFA game, aims to blend nostalgia with innovation, focusing on creating a game that is both accessible and rich in depth. As Merceron stated, the goal is to return to the core principles that made past football games beloved by fans.

With the game set to stream directly to televisions and mobile devices acting as controllers, this new approach could redefine how we engage with sports gaming. As we look forward to the launch, one can't help but wonder: will this new FIFA game capture the hearts of football fans and gamers alike, or will it struggle to find its footing in a competitive market?
