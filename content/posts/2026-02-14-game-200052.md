The 2026 Taipei International Game Show showcased the vibrant and engaging "Dolls Frontline 2: Exilium" booth, where fans were treated to an array of stunning cosplayers bringing beloved characters to life. This event not only highlighted the game's popularity but also created a lively atmosphere filled with excitement and creativity.

Visitors were captivated by the impressive displays, including a memory puzzle game that rewarded players based on their commander level in the app. The booth featured a variety of cosplayers, including the cool and charismatic "Macchiato" and the alluring "Sentau Lacey" in a swimsuit, making for a delightful experience for attendees. The blend of cute and cool character representations truly embodied the essence of the game.

As we reflect on this year's event, it's clear that the intersection of gaming and cosplay continues to thrive, creating memorable experiences for fans. What are your thoughts on the future of cosplay at gaming conventions? Will we see even more interactive experiences in the years to come?
