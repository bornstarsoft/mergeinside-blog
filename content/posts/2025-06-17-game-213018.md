In a recent announcement, Gearbox has confirmed that the standard edition of Borderlands 4 will be priced at $70, dispelling earlier concerns about a potential $80 price tag. This decision comes after CEO Randy Pitchford faced backlash for his remarks implying that "real fans" would find a way to pay higher prices. The confirmation of the $70 price point aims to reassure gamers while also addressing the rising costs associated with game development.

Alongside the standard edition, Gearbox is offering a $130 Super Deluxe Edition, which includes additional content and DLC, and a $150 Collectorâ€™s Edition that does not include the game itself. This tiered pricing strategy indicates Gearbox's commitment to providing value through both free and paid post-launch content, including new characters, regions, and story missions. As the gaming landscape evolves, the balance between pricing and perceived value becomes increasingly crucial.

As we look ahead to the release on September 12, 2025, the gaming community is left to ponder: will the content delivered justify the price, and how will this affect future pricing strategies in the industry?
