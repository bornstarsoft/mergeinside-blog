Capcom is set to revolutionize the gaming experience with its advanced RE Engine, which now includes cutting-edge long hair technology, thanks to the upcoming game Pragmata. This innovation marks a significant leap forward in character design, allowing for more realistic and visually stunning representations of characters, particularly those with long hair, like the young android girl, Diana.

The RE Engine, which has powered over 20 Capcom titles since its debut in Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, is designed to be versatile, accommodating various game genres from survival horror to fighting games. Each new game developed with this engine brings the opportunity for enhancements, as teams can collaborate with the RE Engine developers to introduce new features that will benefit future projects.

As we look forward to Pragmata's release in 2026, the implications of this technology extend beyond just aesthetics. Could we see a future where even zombies in Resident Evil games sport realistic long hair? The possibilities are exciting, and it leaves us wondering how this will shape the visual storytelling in gaming.
