Stellar Blade studio Shift Up has set a remarkable standard in employee appreciation by gifting its staff substantial bonuses and high-end tech products. Recently, the South Korean studio celebrated the new year by providing each of its approximately 300 employees with a cash bonus of 5 million (around $3,400), along with Apple AirPods Max and an Apple Watch. This gesture, valued at over $4,000 per employee, underscores the company's commitment to recognizing and rewarding talent.

This isnt an isolated incident; Shift Up has a history of generous gifts, including iPhone 14s and prepaid credit cards in previous years. The studio's CEO, Kim Hyung Tae, emphasizes that these regular bonuses are designed to foster talent retention and motivate employees. As the company continues to grow, including a successful IPO and partnerships with major players like Tencent, it will be interesting to see how Shift Up evolves its employee engagement strategies in the competitive gaming landscape.

As we look to the future, how will other companies in the tech industry respond to Shift Up's model of employee appreciation? Will we see a shift towards more generous rewards as a standard practice?
