The gaming world is buzzing with excitement as Daniel Knight, the creator of the viral horror hit Phasmophobia, announces the launch of Kinetic Publishing. This new publishing label aims to support and uplift indie game developers by providing essential funding and advisory support, all while firmly rejecting AI-generated content and blockchain elements. This bold stance sets Kinetic apart in an industry increasingly influenced by technology-driven trends.

Knight's vision for Kinetic Publishing is clear: to champion creativity within the indie space. With a growing team of 40, Knight believes now is the perfect time to expand into publishing, helping developers bring their ideas to life without compromising their creative control. Asim Tanvir, the newly appointed director of marketing and partnerships, echoes this sentiment, emphasizing the desire to support solo developers and small teams across various genres, from cozy games to RPGs.

As the indie game landscape continues to evolve, Kinetic Publishing's commitment to traditional game development methods may inspire a wave of creativity and innovation. Will this approach resonate with developers looking for a supportive partner in their creative journey? Only time will tell.
