Indie game development team Team Afternoon is set to release their innovative game "Don't You Trust Me?" on February 6, 2026, for free on Steam. This game offers a unique twist on traditional gaming by placing players in the role of a video editor tasked with creating a "perfect clear video" from a failed dungeon raid, all set against a nostalgic Windows 98 backdrop. 

The gameplay revolves around precise timeline editing, where players must analyze enemy attack patterns and strategically arrange clips to fabricate an illusion of victory. With features like post-processing effects and optimization goals, the game promises to challenge players' creativity and strategic thinking. The satirical narrative adds depth, contrasting the perceived heroism with the chaotic reality behind the scenes. 

As we anticipate its release, one can't help but wonder how this blend of humor and strategy will resonate with gamers. Will players embrace the challenge of crafting perfection from imperfection?
