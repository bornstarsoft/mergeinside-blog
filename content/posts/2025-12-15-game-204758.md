Long-lost NES puzzle game Xcavator, initially developed in 1991 by Chris Oberth, is making a comeback thanks to a collaboration between iam8bit and the Video Game History Foundation. This exciting revival not only brings a piece of gaming history back to life but also highlights the importance of preserving our digital heritage. Priced at $100, the upcoming 2025 release will feature an authentic NES cartridge and a detailed manual that delves into the game's troubled past and Oberths career.

The resurrection of Xcavator serves as a reminder of the challenges faced in preserving 8-bit history, a task that the Video Game History Foundation is dedicated to. With profits from this release supporting their archival efforts, fans of retro gaming can now own a tangible piece of history while contributing to its preservation. As we look forward to the release, one can't help but wonder: what other hidden gems from the past are waiting to be uncovered?
