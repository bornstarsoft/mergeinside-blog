A pre-release build of the much-anticipated but ultimately canceled PS5 game, Concord, has surfaced online, raising eyebrows among gaming enthusiasts. This development build, dubbed FWChaos, is reportedly dated November 14, 2023, suggesting it was compiled just nine months before its intended launch in August 2024. The authenticity of the leak has been confirmed by VGC, making it a significant moment for fans and developers alike.

Upon loading the game, players encounter a login screen that cannot be bypassed. However, the inclusion of an .ini file allows access to a developer menu, leading to a Select Freegunner screen. Unfortunately, it seems players are unable to proceed further, as no characters are available for selection. Nonetheless, the build offers glimpses into the game's structure, including a partially completed Galactic Guide and a Crew section detailing 16 playable characters and their outfits.

The presence of a Job Board and a Store option, both currently non-functional, hints at the ambitious scope of Concord. Additionally, the developer options available in the Settings menu provide insight into the game's development process. As more details emerge from this leak, it raises questions about what could have been for Concord and how it might influence future projects from Sony and Firewalk Studios.

What are your thoughts on the leaked build? Do you think it will impact the gaming community's perception of canceled projects?
